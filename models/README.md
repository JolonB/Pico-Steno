# Keycaps

The keycap has been generated by using the scripts made avilable by Robert Sheldon (rshelldiii on GitHub).
The keycap generator scripts for OpenSCAD can be found [here](https://github.com/rsheldiii/keyV2).

You can import `steno_key.stl` into the slicer of your choice.
I suggest reducing the top and bottom layer count to 3 and the wall line count to 2.
This is for two reasons: you don't need a super strong key and it allows more backlight through.
With just these changes, a full set of keys takes no more than 5 hours to print with a 0.16 mm layer height.

My `customizer.json` file used in the `customizer.scad` script is made available in this directory.
You should be able to import this and switch to the `flat` preset.
This may be useful if you want to make additional modifications to the keycap; adding labels, for example.
